# to test also

* contrast between pairs and group
* [X] check p(opt) corr with real parameters 
* [X] check ff variance is correct estimated (SIM)->  check using code outside)
* in slide add dynamic fit + confusion matrices

# fit

* [X] recovery of real parameters (instead of fake) for both absolute and absolute-var 
* [X] estimate variance only on ff (and check if estimated variance is correct -> check using code outside)
* refit with absolute-var and absolute fixed wv0
* refit with likelihood_var = p * (1-p) (try with +?) [X]
* tester xopt_absolute_var_fixed_wv (plot params+BIC+simu) -> still as before
* if not working perhaps rerun fit as i'm not sure i saved the cell before running/refit with infinite param????

 
# Why fit variance

* no variance hypothesis
* different  variance depending on dimension
* variance
