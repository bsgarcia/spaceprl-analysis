","On round 4, I put some very earnest effort into figuring out which spaceships were the best, and I felt like I had an idea which 2 were the top 2, and which one was clearly the worst.  Having said that, I still never figured out the forcefields other than the darker the better.  So if there was some deeper methodology, like spaceship X is the best when it has a lighter forcefield, and spaceship Z is the best when it has a darker forcefield, I didn't catch on.   I spent a minute or so trying to actually select based  on perceived spaceship points, and ignoring the forcefields, and I got SO MANY misses that I started feeling really bad.  So ultimately I gave it all up and went back to the darker forcefield no matter what, and just regretted when I knew it was the ""worst"" ship, for example.",

With forcefields that were similar and one clearly had more black, that was the one that I assessed to be weaker, and there seemed to be a pattern.","It was clear once shooting all the spaceship types which ones gave the best reward","This is where it got more complex. The same rules applied to the forcefield, where the weakness could either be represented by black or white, so it was a toss up between the forcefield choice. A big deciding factor was the spaceship type when choosing to shoot at one or the other. Sometimes, even if the forcefield seemed weaker on the spaceship that gave a lower reward, it was worth the gamble to shoot at the spaceship with the higher reward given the uncertainty of the forcefield color. In situations where the spaceships were the same, the choice was made using only the forcefield. In some cases where there was a low reward ship next to a high reward ship, if the low reward ship had a forcefield that I perceived as being the definite weaker one, I would shoot at the lower reward ship to get the points rather than most likely getting no points if I shot at the higher reward ship that was more likely to have the stronger forcefield.","Feedback is the same as game 3, however in this game the ships were different and it took slightly longer to learn the ship reward values with the forcefields being present from the start.
